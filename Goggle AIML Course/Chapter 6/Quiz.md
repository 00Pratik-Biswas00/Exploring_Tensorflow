#### 1.

Model Maker abstracts a lot of the specifics of designing the neural network so you donâ€™t have to deal with network design, and things like ->
Convolutions, Dense, ReLu, Flatten, Loss Functions, Optimizers.

#### 2.

#### 3.

True or false? The confidence threshold sets a bar for the quality of predictions to return. -> True

#### 4.

The -> setMaxResultCount() -> function is useful in models with a lot of classes.
