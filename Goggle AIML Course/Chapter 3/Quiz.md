## Answers

#### 1.

Validation samples -> samples are used to decide when to stop training to avoid overfitting.

#### 2.

test -> samples are used to measure how well the model can generalize and recognize objects that it has never seen before.

#### 3.

True or false? Given an image or a video stream, an image classification model can identify which of a known set of objects might be present, and provide information about their positions within the image. -> False

#### 4.

Model maker -> is a Python library that makes it easy to train TensorFlow Lite models using your own data with just a few lines of code, no machine learning expertise required.
